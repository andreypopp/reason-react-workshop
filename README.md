# ReasonReact Workshop: TodoMVC

We are going to make TodoMVC with ReasonReact!

## IDE

We are assuming you use VSCode. Install [reason-vscode][] extension. For Vim I
recommend ALE.

## Development Workflow

Install project:
```
npm install
```

Start project (each command in its own terminal):
```
npm run start
npm run server
```

Open project at `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.
